## ☁️Salesforce Commerce Cloud
is a SaaS e-commerce platform provided by `Salesforce`. Salesforce has a lot of products. The main is following CRM products:
- Sales Cloud
- Service Cloud
- Marketing Cloud
- Commerce Cloud 👈
- ...and more clouds...

## Came from ☄️
Commerce Cloud in the list above was the Demandware. Salesforce acquired Demandware in 2016, And changed its name to Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Therefore, there are still many traces of Demandware in this!😳  
(For ex, name of some files or API package is included 'dw' and the URL of Sandbox is a subdomain of 'demandware.net')

## How is it structured? 👀
It consists of the MVC architectural pattern.
- Model: API
- View: ISML(It is expanded HTML)
- Controller: Javascript
When I first started using SFCC, my experience with Express.js was helpful.👏
