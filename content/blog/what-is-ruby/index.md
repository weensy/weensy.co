### Introduction

When I first came across Ruby, it was on the GitHub blog.
The GitHub blog is built with Jekyll a static site generator. This Jekyll is made of ruby.
So I became interested in the language Ruby, and I want to find out about it.

## Ruby; A programmer's best friend

- Ruby is developed programming language by Matsumoto Yukihiro In 1995
- Similar to Python
- Script language(: A language used to control existing software. Ex; JavaScript, Python...)
- All APIs are written in Japanese.

<del> I thought, 'Why are there so many places in Japan that use ruby?', and this seems to be the reason. </del>

## Ruby on Rails

- Web framework using Ruby(Ex; JavaScript - Node.js, Swift - Vapor)
- Open source
- So easy to learn
- Pure object-oriented language
- [Meta programmable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)
- This framework is what made Ruby famous
