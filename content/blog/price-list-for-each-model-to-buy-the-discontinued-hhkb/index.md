#### Why did I research this
1. Wireless models are annoying because the battery compartment protrudes. So I'm going to buy a wired model.
2. Among the wired models, Pro2 and Pro2 Type-S are currently discontinued, and the new released one is Pro Classic.
3. Classic doesn't seem to be any different from Pro2 except that USB is changed to Type C.
4. However, Classic has no Type-S model (Type-S is a low-noise model)
5. Therefore, the wired Type-S must be obtained through second-hand transactions.
6. When I looked at the second hand stuffs, I didn't know how much the reasonable price, so I researched the regular price.
